        <p>English is a West Germanic language in the Indo-European language family, whose speakers, called Anglophones,
            originated in early medieval England on the island of Great Britain. The namesake of the language is the
            Angles,
            one of the ancient Germanic peoples that migrated to Britain.</p>

        Early Modern English

        The changes in the English language during this period occurred from the 15th to mid-17th Century, and signified
        not only a change in pronunciation, vocabulary or grammar itself but also the start of the English Renaissance.

        The English Renaissance has much quieter foundations than its pan-European cousin, the Italian Renaissance, and
        sprouted during the end of the 15th century. It was associated with the rebirth of societal and cultural
        movements, and while slow to gather steam during the initial phases, it celebrated the heights of glory during
        the Elizabethan Age.

        It was William Caxton’s innovation of an early printing press that allowed Early Modern English to become
        mainstream, something we as English learners should be grateful for! The Printing Press was key in standardizing
        the English language through distribution of the English Bible.

        Caxton’s publishing of Thomas Malory’s Le Morte d’Arthur (the Death of Arthur) is regarded as print material’s
        first bestseller. Malory’s interpretation of various tales surrounding the legendary King Arthur and the Knights
        of the Round Table, in his own words, and the ensuing popularity indirectly ensured that Early Modern English
        was here to stay.

        It was during Henry the VIII’s reign that English commoners were finally able to read the Bible in a language
        they understood, which to its own degree, helped spread the dialect of the common folk.

        The end of the 16th century brought about the first complete translation of the Catholic Bible, and though it
        didn’t make a markable impact, it played an important role in the continued development of the English language,
        especially with the English-speaking Catholic population worldwide.

        The end of the 16th and start of the 17th century would see the writings of actor and playwright, William
        Shakespeare, take the world by storm.

        Why was Shakespeare’s influence important during those times? Shakespeare started writing during a time when the
        English language was undergoing serious changes due to contact with other nations through war, colonisation, and
        the likes. These changes were further cemented through Shakespeare and other emerging playwrights who found
        their ideas could not be expressed through the English language currently in circulation. Thus, the “adoption”
        of words or phrases from other languages were modified and added to the English language, creating a richer
        experience for all concerned.

        It was during the early 17th century that we saw the establishment of the first successful English colony in
        what was called The New World. Jamestown, Virginia, also saw the dawn of American English with English
        colonizers adopting indigenous words, and adding them to the English language.

        The constant influx of new blood due to voluntary and involuntary (i.e. slaves) migration during the 17th, 18th
        and 19th century meant a variety of English dialects had sprung to life, this included West African, Native
        American, Spanish and European influences.

        Meanwhile, back home, the English Civil War, starting mid-17th century, brought with it political mayhem and
        social instability. At the same time, England’s puritanical streak had taken off after the execution of Charles
        I. Censorship was a given, and after the Parliamentarian victory during the War, Puritans promoted an austere
        lifestyle in reaction to what they viewed as excesses by the previous regime[7]. England would undergo little
        more than a decade under Puritan leadership before the crowning of Charles II. His rule, effectively the return
        of the Stuart Monarchy, would bring about the Restoration period which saw the rise of poetry, philosophical
        writing, and much more.

        It was during this age that literary classics, like those of John Milton’s Paradise Lost, were published, and
        are considered relevant to this age!
